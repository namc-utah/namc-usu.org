## Our Mission

The National Aquatic Monitoring Center is a cooperative venture between Utah State University and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Our purpose is toencourage and foster scientifically sound watershed monitoring programs on public lands. Our goals are to increase the consistency and quality of aquatic resource assessments and provide clear, accurate, and timely information to resource managers and the public. A primary focus at our laboratory is the processing of aquatic invertebrate samples. Please contact us if you are in need of our assistance.

## New Developments

- WRSA: The Western Rivers and Streams Assessment (WRSA) is a survey of the condition of BLM streams and rivers throughout the contiguous western U.S. The objective of this effort is to generate unbiased, quantitative condition estimates from which regional and national aquatic priorities can be established and future conditions can be compared.
- Oviposition: The abundance and composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages found below large dams varies tremendously throughout the Intermountain West. Such variability has been extensively studied in relation to altered thermal regimes, sediment supply and the trophic basis for secondary production. However, no studies have investigated population viability as a function of oviposition (egg-laying) constraints imposed by dam operations.
