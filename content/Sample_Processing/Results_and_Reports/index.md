## Data Ownership Policy

Our policy on data ownership is that unless you tell us in writing that the data generated from our field or laboratory work are proprietary we will make these data available to anyone who asks for them as soon as they have been checked and entered into our computer system. We believe that to enhance biomonitoring procedures and the quality of our nation's waters we should work cooperatively. We believe this means we should openly share ideas and data.

Our policy is the same for the organisms we identify. We keep all of the organisms we identify and unless you tell us in writing not to, we will lend these organisms to anyone who requests them.

Specific questions regarding this policy should be directed to Trip Armstrong (trip.armstrong@usu.edu).
