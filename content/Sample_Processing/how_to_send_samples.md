1. Fix samples with 95% ethanol in the field.
1. Label samples inside and outside.
    1. Internal labels: Pencil on waterproof paper (such as “Rite-in-the-Rain"). Do **NOT** use pen.
    1. External labels: Pencil on paper or masking tape works well for outside labels.
    1. Information: Both internal and external labels should, at a minimum, include information about the location of the sample and the date of sampling.
    1. Jar Numbers: Place a consecutive sample number on the lid of each jar, samples requiring more than one jar should be labeled as 1 of 2, 2 of 2 OR 1a, 1b, 1c, etc.. We will composite multiple jars (Jar 1 of 2 and Jar 2 of 2) into a single sample in the laboratory.
1. Record complete information on where, when, and how the samples were collected.
    a. Submit information to our lab via the online tool: http://usu.edu/buglab/sampleProcessing/sampleSubmission/
    b. The minimum information recommended is:
        i. Site Name (specifying distances from tributaries, landmarks, cities, etc)
        ii. GPS coordinates (Latitude/Longitude or UTM format)
        iii. County/State
        iv. Sampling date
        v. Sampling device (Surber, Kicknet, etc.)
        vi. Habitat sampled (riffle, pool, etc.)
        vii. Total area sampled in square meters or square feet
    c. Additional physical and chemical data collection are encouraged in the field, but do not need to be provided during sample submission unless additional reporting has been arranged prior.
1. To prepare for shipping, follow the guidelines for Class 3 (Flammable Liquid) Hazardous Materials according to your chosen carrier’s guidelines. General guidelines are as follows:
    a. Make sure the lids are on tightly. To be careful, you may wrap duct tape around the lids.
    b. Place individual samples in ziploc baggies or other secondary sealed containers lined with absorbent material (such as paper towels) for support, cushion, and to absorb any leaks.
    c. Place data sheets, including forms generated in the online submission, and any other paper documentation in a separate zip-lock plastic bag.
    d. As specified by your carrier, mark package as Hazardous Material and fill out a Shipping Declaration for Dangerous Goods form to accompany the package (keep a copy for your records).
    e. If HazMat shipping is not an option for your institution, please contact us concerning options for overnight shipping in water.
    f. Ship samples, data sheets, and any additional information concerning the samples to:
        BLM/USU National Aquatic Monitoring Center (BugLab)
        Department of Watershed Sciences
        Utah State University
        5210 Old Main Hill
        Logan, UT 84322-5210.
1. Upon receipt of your samples we will notify you via email.
