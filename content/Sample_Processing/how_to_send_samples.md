# Overview of sample submissions

    1. NAMC accepts the following sample types:
        - benthic macroinvertebrate samples
        - drift samples
        - fish diet samples
        - water quality samples for measuring total Nitrogen and total Phosphorus
    2. Samples must be properly prepared and delivered or shipped to NAMC
    3. Sample metadata must be subimtted through NAMC's online submission portal
    
# Preparing samples for shipping
## Preparations in the Field
1. Fix samples with 95% ethanol in the field.
1. Label samples inside and outside.
    - Internal labels: Pencil on waterproof paper (such as â€œRite-in-the-Rain"). Do **NOT** use pen.
    - External labels: Pencil on paper or masking tape works well for outside labels.
    - Information: Both internal and external labels should, at a minimum, include information about the location of the sample and the date of sampling.
    - Jar Numbers: Place a consecutive sample number on the lid of each jar, samples requiring more than one jar should be labeled as 1 of 2, 2 of 2 or 1a, 1b, 1c,         etc.. NAMC will composite multiple jars (Jar 1 of 2 and Jar 2 of 2) into a single sample in the laboratory.

## Preparations in the office
1. Samples should be preserved in ethanol (70-95%) unless one has made prior arrangements with our lab.  
2. Follow the guidelines for Class 3 (Flammable Liquid) Hazardous Materials according to your chosen carrier's guidelines.  If one does not have a hazardous materials permit, samples can be shipped overnight in water provided the samples were in ethanol prior to shipment.  If shipping in water, one must let NAMC know shipping. 
3. General packaging guidelines are as follows:

    - Send an email to [Andrew Caudillo](Andrew.caudillo@usu.edu) to inform NAMC that one is shipping samples.
    - Ensure lids are on tightly. Wrapping electric tape around the lids ensures less liquid will leak during transport.
    - Place individual samples in watertight or other secondary sealed containers lined with absorbent material (such as paper towels) for support, cushion, and to         absorb any leaks. 
    - Mark package as Hazardous Material and fill out a Shipping Declaration for Dangerous Goods form to accompany the package (and keep a copy for records).
    - Ensure return label includes organization name and contact name.
    - It is not necessary to include any paperwork with the sample shipment.
    
4. Use the following shipping address:
        
        BLM/USU National Aquatic Monitoring Center
        Department of Watershed Sciences
        Utah State University
        5210 Old Main Hill
        Logan, UT 84322-5210

# Electronic submission of metadata
1. Record complete information on where, when, and how the samples were collected.
    1. Submit information to our lab via our [INSTAR](http://instar.namc-usu.org) online tool.
    1. The minimum information required include (example is for benthic samples, metadata for other sample types varies):
            - Site ID
            - Sample date
            - Jar count
            - Field split
            - Latitude and Longitude
            - Waterbody name
            - Ecosystem: Habitat (stream, river, lake, wetland, mesocosm)
            - Sample Design (targeted, transect, proportional)
            - Sample Effort (area, time, not standardized)
            - Area or time (total area sampled, or time spent sampling)
            - Sampler type (eg., Surber, Kick, Hess)
       
    1. Additional physical and chemical data collection are encouraged in the field, but do not need to be provided during sample submission unless additional reporting has been arranged prior.

    1. Visit www.instar.namc-usu.org for any clarification on these instructions or the submission process.

    1. NAMC will send email notification when samples arrive.
