# Project Description:

The National Aquatic Monitoring Center is spearheading the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) effort to develop a national aquatic monitoring framework under the BLM’s Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring (AIM) Strategy. The objective of this effort is to standardize aquatic core monitoring indicators, sampling methodologies and survey designs to facilitate consistent status and trend determinations of BLM aquatic resources. Such a framework is needed to effectively manage the processes that sustain functioning aquatic ecosystems at multiple spatial scales and across programmatic and political boundaries, as required by Federal Land and Policy Management Act, the Clean Water Act and outlined in the BLM’s Landscape Approach to Managing Public Lands. Through this process, the BLM seeks to answer fundamental questions such as: (1) What is the status and trend of aquatic systems; (2) What are potential stressors to aquatic systems; and (3) Are conservation and restoration actions achieving established objectives? There is a recognized need to not only be able to answer these questions at a local scale, but also at a regional or national scale. Implementation of a Bureau-wide aquatic monitoring framework will facilitate the integration and applicability of data both through space (e.g., field office level to national scale) and time to address local management questions and national initiatives under a common, scientifically defensible monitoring framework.

Conceptual model of the key ecosystem processes (ovals) and example structural attributes (rectangles) characteristic of functioning lotic ecosystems. This model will be used to identify priority ecosystem processes and attributes for which aquatic core indicators will be developed. Model adapted from Gregory et al., 1997.
