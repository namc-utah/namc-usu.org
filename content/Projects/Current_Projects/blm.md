# Description

The Western Rivers and Streams Assessment (WRSA) is a survey of the condition of BLM streams and rivers throughout the contiguous western U.S. The objective of this effort is to generate unbiased, quantitative condition estimates from which regional and national aquatic priorities can be established and future conditions can be compared. The BLM will partner with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agenciesâ€™ (EPA) National, Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) to intensify sampling for BLM perennial streams and rivers to accomplish this task. Tentative sample sites can be viewed at: http://arcg.is/1h6tDgq. The WRSA will provide the first-ever, statistically valid estimates of the chemical, physical and biological condition of streams and rivers managed by the BLM.
