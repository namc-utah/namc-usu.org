# Project Description

The piscicides rotenone and antimycin A are ubiquitously used throughout the Western United States as a management tool to assist in the restoration of native trout populations. Despite the success of eradicating non-native fishes through chemical treatment, piscicide use is under increasing public scrutiny and is the focus of several ongoing lawsuits. The primary concern is impacts to non-target organisms such as aquatic macroinvertebrates and amphibians, which play key roles in aquatic ecosystems by processing and transferring energy and nutrients to higher trophic levels. Despite the publication of over 20 peer-reviewed articles, a recent review found questionable results for the effects of piscicides on macroinvertebrates. While some studies demonstrated no significant impacts to macroinvertebrate density or composition, others found significant impacts, with the magnitude and duration of impacts varying among studies. One of the primary causes for the conflicting results among studies appears to be inadequate study designs and a failure to consider variability associated with chemical concentrations, type of system being treated (e.g, stream, lake, wetland), macroinvertebrate life history strategies or other covariates.

To provide comprehensive recommendations regarding the effects of piscisides on macroinvertebrates, the National Aquatic Monitoring Center is collaborating with the U.S. Forest Service and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources to systematically study proposed rotenone treatments within the native range of Colorado River and Bonneville Cutthroat trout. Specifically, we are targeting rotenone treatments planned for a physiographic range of stream, wetland (specifically ground water dependent systems), and lake systems that will allow us to test hypotheses concerning differential response and recovery rates related to macroinvertebrate life history strategies (e.g., mode of respiration, size, dispersal capacity).
