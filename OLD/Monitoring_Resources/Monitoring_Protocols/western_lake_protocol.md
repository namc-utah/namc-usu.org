1. Determine and record site location information: lake name, latitude, longitude, elevation, sampling date and time, and personnel collecting data.
2. Draw map of lake and delineate major habitat types and locations where the 10 invertebrate samples will be collected. Photograph lake.
3. Determine alkalinity, pH, conductivity, water temperature from water collected in littoral zone.
4. Collect 3 types of invertebrate samples to be placed into 4 containers:
    a. Zooplankton sample – collect 2 zooplankton tows in deepest water possible. Place this sample in a 50 ml vial half-filled with 70% ethanol. Top off vial with water if necessary, so that final preservative is about 35% ethanol. Label sample with sample location, sampling date, type of sample – “Zooplankton sample”, net tow distance, and the vial number.
    b. Littoral invertebrate sampling - 10 sample composite; to be separated into field sorted bugs and remaining debris
        i. Collect 10 – 1 m long sweep net samples at locations spaced equally distanced around the entire lake or a major portion of the lake if the lake exceeds 20 acres. At each sampling location determine and note the major habitat type in that sampling area and collect the sample from that habitat type (e.g., vegetation, silt, sand, cobbles, bedrock). Disturb the bottom and pass the net through the water column over a 1 m distance. Composite all 10 samples into a singe sample.
        ii. Place the entire sample into a bucket and using washing and elutriation techniques, process the sample to remove sand, gravel, and plants. Be careful not to exclude invertebrates clinging to plants or cased caddis, snails, and clams. Place these taxa into the elutriated portion of the sample. Place this material into a pan and sort through it removing a minimum of 500 invertebrates or more if you continue to find new taxa. Remove organisms in proportion to their abundance. Place all organisms into a single sample vial filled with 70% ethanol. Label sample with sample location, sampling date, type of sample – “10 sample composite bugs”, and the vial number.
        iii. Put the remaining debris and un-sorted invertebrates into a 500 ml jar pre-filled with 90% ethanol. If the volume of remaining material will not fit into 2 jars, split the material without bias until you have a volume of material that will fit into 2 – 500 ml jars and keep track of the percentage of the sample that you are bringing back to the lab, e.g., 50% of the original material. Label sample with sample location, sampling date, type of sample – “10 sample composite debris”, the percentage of the original sample in the jar, and the sample number.
        iv. Record the number of samples collected from each major habitat type. For example, 3 from vegetation, 4 from sand, and 3 from silt.
    c. Standard BugLab single lake-wide composite sample
        i. Sample all habitats present in the lake or a major portion of the lake if the lake exceeds 20 acres.
        ii. Place samples into a bucket and using washing and elutriation techniques, process the samples to remove sand, gravel, and plants. Be careful not to exclude invertebrates clinging to plants or cased caddis, snails, and clams. Following elutriation, place the invertebrates and detritus remaining in the bucket into a pan. Sort through this material and remove a minimum of 500 invertebrates or more if you continue to find new taxa. Remove organisms in proportion to their abundance. If few individuals are found at a lake, collect and sort for a maximum of 1 hour. Place all organisms into a single sample vial filled with 70% ethanol. Label sample with sample location, sampling date, type of sample – “BugLab composite”, and the vial number.
5. Leave lake with 4 samples:
    a. Zooplankton.
    b. 10 sample composite sample vial with 500+ individuals and no debris.
    c. 10 sample composite sample with remaining invertebrates and debris in 1 or 2 - 500 ml jars.
    d. A lake-wide composite of 500+ individuals, no debris.
